Our application aims to create a platform for professors to check whether the students are having a hard time understanding the materials through the course. By adopting AI technology in facial recognition, we use camera as sensor to recognize the emotion from the faces of students. The sensor will send an alert to the professor once it detects that over 70% (modifiable) of students are confused by the curriculum during the lecture. The professor can then select from sets of questions and send to the students to determine which topics that student are still unclear of. Students can sign into the system using their seat number and safety code, set up by the professor at the beginning of the class.
